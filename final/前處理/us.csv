I encourage everyone to watch until the end, especially if they watched the original video.In this video we hear from a statistical expert with a PhD that wrote a 19 page analysis on what the mods did wrong.

I think I chugged that stuff when I was a kid and wanted candy because it's liquid candy. Anyway, what I'm saying is I recommend corn syrup.

Baby Yoda, The Child is being used for his force sensitivity, to transfer that to another body. While all tests haven't succeeded, Moff Gideon and Dr. Pershing are committed to making it happen. This is interesting as I think they could even search Luke Skywalker for his force sensitivity and high midichlorian count. I was happy to hear about the M-Count which we haven't heard of since Qui-Gon Jinn mentioned them in The Phantom Menace when he tested Anakin and sent the sample to Obi-Wan Kenobi.This episode took alot of elements from Jedi Knight II which was interesting to see.Cloning force sensitives is a hard feat, something that Palpatine and Dooku could not do with General Grievous. Something Vader couldn't do with Galen Marek in The Force Unleashed II. It seems, though, that Snoke was created via this process, and maybe his force sensitivity was granted from The Child, which feels weird. Or perhaps, it's from someone else...Luke? Ahsoka? Another force user?I'm excited for Episode 5 to finally see Ahsoka Tano and hopefully Boba Fett and Bo Katan later one (maybe Ezra and Sabine too).A wild theory I have, is that Mace Windu could appear...I'll have a full video on it tomorrow for you...Let me know what you thought of the episode!Become a Patron to support future content - https://www.patreon.com/StarWarsTheoryJoin this channel to get access to perks:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q/join",280.5103,23,1537,6,726

We started ¡§travel hacking¡¨ & finally decided we wanted to travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this #travelvlog to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling! After achieving our new goal of 100 countries before 2020 and all 7 continents, we have no plans to slow down anytime soon, and we are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)",232.59534,30,2030,4,1004

Both sides were still vying for a spot in the knockout stage and RB Leipzig made their presence known jumping out to a three goal lead but Manchester United staged a late comeback that with a Bruno Fernandes goal in the 80¡¦ and a Paul Pogba goal in the 82¡¦ but it was too little too late and Leipzig got the win.  Leipzig wasted no time scoring in this match as Angelino opened things up in the 2¡¦. From there, they doubled their lead in the 13¡¦ with a Haidara goal, they held onto that 2-0 lead going into half. In the 69¡¦ Leipzig tacked on a much needed third goal when Kluivert found the back of the net. Man. United got one back when Bruno Fernandes powered it home from the penalty spot in the 80¡¦ to cut the Leipzig lead to 3-1. Then just two minutes later Paul Pogba, who had come on as a substitute, gave Manchester United life when he headed one home to cut the lead to one. That would be all the English side could muster, unable to find the back of the net in the match¡¦s final minutes and with Leipzig holding on for the win, Manchester United will not advance to the UEFA Champions League knockout stage.

The Series X internal storage is a 1 TB Custom NVME SSD. You can play games in 4K at 120fps providing you have the appropriate gaming monitor / TV like the LG CX that I have in this video.  90hz refresh rate 6.76 OLED display, a 50MP Camera, and 4K video! The controller is almost identical to the Xbox One controller but there have been a few subtle changes which many will like.

You're going to follow along with me as I fully design and engineer 3 brand new builds from scratch... from how I come up the idea, all the way through bringing the final builds to life.The best part is, over the month, you'll follow along with me and my process, side by side, and you will leave the class with 3 original, creative builds of your own.This is the class I wish I had when I was starting out. It's designed to take your skills to make cool stuff to the next level, whether you're a beginner or a more experienced maker/engineer.The class officially starts on January 4, 2021, and it will only run a few times per year, so claim your spot if you're interested!See you in class!-Mark",2655.61328,0,1180,7,538

Today I am doing a video that was honestly DEMANDED by some people in my comment sections recently <U+0001F602> Many of you really wanted to see my attempt to Fix The Unfixable, sooooo, here I go. This special episode of squishy makeovers will be me attempting to fix and redecorate squishies from the WORST or worst. These extremely damaged squishies come from my hopeless bin and I was honestly not sure if they would ever make it out!Also, I am aware that this whole spamming of my comment setions kind of started a war between those who were doing it and those who thought it was really annoying <U+0001F602> I appreciate those of you who didn't want me to be pressured into doing a video I didn't want to do! Don't worry, I'm happy to give it a try. And I appreciate getting video requests from you guys.DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE COUSIN DERP PLUSH!https://moriahelizabethmerch.com/AND The new Christmas apparel design is now available here:https://moriah-elizabeth.teespring.com/listing/special-holiday-collection?product=345_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! 3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh <U+0001F602> ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess.

So, it looks like it's here to stay - and if you're looking for your shop tab, check the bottom bar!Hello friends! Today, I return to the land of internet hauls and social media targeted recommendations - with a deep dive into the Instagram shop tab! Previously, I have bought things recommended to me via targeted ads on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat - and when the shop tab was rolled out - peeking its lil head out from behind the explore page - I was instantly intrigued. So I spent an evening perusing the shop tab, finding 3 different common themes of what Instagram wanted me to buy, and then purchasing those things, and trying them out.

Eddie Van Halen had battled all kinds of cancer for years, and it was originally reported that the guitar god succumbed to lung cancer. Van Halen was diagnosed with throat cancer in 2000, following years of cigarettes and booze ... and guitar picks? He would later say he believed the cancer was caused by the metal in the pick he often held in his mouth. Either way, he had part of his tongue removed in 2002, and he said it was the part that his copper and brass guitar picks always touched.He was regularly treated for the cancer through the years, but it eventually began to spread even further through his body, including to his lungs. When he died, it was announced that he had lost his battle with cancer. However, according to his death certificate obtained by TMZ, while Eddie definitely did suffer from several debilitating medical conditions ¡X including lung and skin cancers, pneumonia, and a disorder affecting the bone marrow called myelodysplastic syndrome ¡X the official cause of death was a stroke.TMZ also reported Eddie's wishes about what should be done with his remains. His body was cremated 22 days after his death, and the ashes were received by his son, Wolfgang. The Eruption soloist's final wishes stated that his ashes be scattered in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Malibu. Eddie and Wolfgang were very close both on and off stage, so you can bet that Wolfgang will honor his father's final wishes. Wolfgang tweeted the day his father died,He was the best father I could ever ask for. Every moment I've shared with him on and off stage was a gift. [...] I love you so much, Pop.Released on November 16, the first single on Wolfgang's pending first solo album was a tribute to his late father. According to Guitar World, Wolfgang dedicated the song Distance to Eddie, saying it was one of his father's favorites on the album. Wolfgang said, 'Distance' is a song that was initially written for the debut album, but was going to be held for a later time. [...] As my pop continued to struggle with various health issues, I was imagining what my life would be like without him and how terribly I'd miss him. While this song is incredibly personal, I think anyone can relate to the idea of having a profound loss in their own life. He said he hadn't planned on the song being the first solo tune of his that the public would hear, but he decided to release it in honor of his father's legacy. Saying, This is for him.Eddie said before he passed that the album sounded like, AC/DC meets Van Halen meets aggressive pop. The riffs are catchy. It's a little of everything and sounds like a freight train coming at you. I've never heard anything quite like it. It's so powerful that I'm jealous. Considering the source of the praise, that's quite the compliment. Now the world waits and listens for what else comes from the next generation of the Van Halen legacy.#EddieVanHalen #VanHalenRead Full Article: https://www.grunge.com/295473/eddie-van-halens-cause-of-death-officially-confirmed/",220.70324,21,3162,6,149

Mr Biden has won more than 73 million votes so far, the most ever for a US presidential candidate. Mr Trump has drawn almost 70 million, the second-highest tally in history.Get the full story <U+0001F449> https://bbc.in/3lditHOFollow the story <U+0001F449> https://bbc.in/2I720GtUS Election 2020 | BBC News | BBC#BBC #BBCNews #BBCiPlayerAll our TV channels and S4C are available to watch live through BBC iPlayer, although some programmes may not be available to stream online due to rights.

It's the same spirit ¡X stripped-down sets, an intimate setting ¡X just a different space.Dec. 4, 2020 | Abby O'Neill -- With a genuine smile stretched across her face, Dua Lipa seems overjoyed to reconnect with her band for their only performance since their tour in support of her sophomore album, Future Nostalgia, was cancelled in March. Glowing from the inside out and accentuated by the apricot hues of a backdrop in a London studio, Dua and her backup vocalists and band bring life and warmth into households in need of levitating and some pep in their step this winter. This vibrant four song set of dance hits, all from Future Nostalgia, will surely have you cutting up the floor in your kitchen while quarantining in the cold weather.While we can't film our Tiny Desk concerts at NPR's D.C. office during the pandemic, our home series has created opportunity for global megastars like Dua Lipa to bring her uptempo dance joints all the way from London. Of Kosovar Albanian descent, Dua Lipa was raised in the UK and rose to super stardom in the three years since her eponymous debut album dropped in 2017. NPR Music featured her in our docu-series Noteworthy at the onset of her career. It's been extraordinary to witness her colossal takeover of the pop music landscape.

The key to getting rid of fat around the waist is to realize that it too, just like all body fat, is something that can be done with persistence and a few important strategies. While there is no such thing as love handle exercises or exercises to burn lower belly fat, there are things you can do in and out of the gym to see results much faster.The first thing you have to do to get rid of fat around the waist or love handles is take a close look at how you¡¦re eating. Nutrition is and always will be the number one priority when it comes to getting ripped and losing body fat. All too often, people want to skip this part of the equation because it is the one that is most difficult to stay consistent with, but it¡¦s where all the difference matters.Many people will turn to different kinds of diets in order to lose fat fast. The problem with most diets is that they are temporary solutions to a long term problem. And even when you follow the ¡§rules¡¨ of the diet plan, that doesn¡¦t necessarily mean that you are going to lose fat. For instance, if your keto plan has you avoiding carbs but you still wind up overeating significantly on fats and proteins and are unable to get to a hypo caloric state, you are not going to lose your love handles.Similarly, if you are following a diet strategy like intermittent fasting as a way of losing the fat around the waistline, be advised that simply eating within the proper window does not guarantee success. Again, if you consume more calories than you are burning off you are not going to burn enough fat to get rid of that around your belly.The second big nutrition mistake relates to the first and that is, even if you can do everything right with your nutrition but you quit too soon you likely will not see the results you¡¦re looking for. Keep in mind that in men especially, waistline and lower belly fat is the last to go. This pertains to the low back as well. You will first start to see fat loss in the face and neck but only when you¡¦ve been consistent for a long period of time will you see the love handles start to disappear. Don¡¦t give up too soon just because you don¡¦t see the fat loss in the love handles. Realize that it¡¦s coming, it just will take a bit more time.As far as training goes, there are some things you can do to get rid of love handles faster. You need to be sure that as the fat loss occurs that the muscles underneath are developed and looking good which will give the appearance of a better looking waistline sooner. Here is where you want to be sure you¡¦re not just doing traditional ab exercises.Train your obliques. People often say that doing oblique exercises will thicken your waistline. This isn¡¦t the significant cause of why you have a thick waist, it¡¦s the body fat laying over the top. So that said, be sure to include a healthy dose of rotational oblique exercises and even add in weighted exercises to be sure that you¡¦re building the muscle and training it hard enough to make a difference in its appearance.Here is where you want to be sure that you¡¦re doing your ab exercises right. The bicycle crunch and russian twists are two moves that many people screw up when trying to train for a trim waistline. Don¡¦t just flip your hands and elbows across your body but be sure to rotate as you do. Lock your hands or elbows in place and rotate your entire torso as you move to really etch in those deep oblique muscles. Finally, don¡¦t forget the broom stick twist. This classic oblique exercise is great for giving you high quality contractions of the obliques to make them pop out as you lose the love handle fat laying over the top of them.If you¡¦re looking for a step by step workout program that includes a meal plan to help you lose fat fast, be sure to head to athleanx.com via the link below and use the program selector to find the workout plan best suited to your goals.

Rock icon and pop culture phenomenon Gwen Stefani reclaims her red chair alongside superstar coaches Kelly Clarkson, John Legend and Blake Shelton for Season 19. Carson Daly returns as host. The show¡¦s innovative format features four stages of competition: the Blind Auditions, the Battle Rounds, Knockouts, and the Live Performance Shows. During the Blind Auditions, the decisions from the musician coaches are based solely on voice and not looks. If a coach is impressed by the artist¡¦s voice, he/she pushes a button to select the artist for his/her team. The singers with the lowest number of votes will be sent home each week. In the end, one will be named ¡§The Voice¡¨ and will receive the grand prize of a recording contract.And the Winner of the Voice Is... - The Voice Live Finale Part 2 2020https://youtu.be/G906Fzw4k7MThe Voicehttp://www.youtube.com/user/nbcthevoice",270.1173,31,2011,5,94

As it has for all of us this global pandemic has flipped our world upside down.  When our Prime Minister announced that he was sending repatriation flights over to Africa to pick up Canadians who were stuck (due to border closures) we consulted with friends and family closest to us and realized that in this time of crisis we should be back in our home country. Halting our dream of driving around the world was a hard pill to swallow which is why we knew we needed a big project to keep our mind + body busy while social distancing back here in Toronto. Enter building an off-grid tiny house on wheels!! But after nearly 6 months, we realized that our dreams of continuing van life across North America in our new van build were not a current reality with the state of the world. So, we've found ourselves pursuing something we've dreamed of since we first got together 8 years ago... a cabin in the woods <U+0001F60A> Tour the renovations we've done to our self converted sprinter van:VAN TOUR after 2 years living in our TINY HOUSE on wheels http://bit.ly/newvantourWhat's in Our Camera Bag? https://www.eamonandbec.com/blogWho are we?We're Eamon and Bec, a Toronto-based couple who live full-time in our self converted Sprinter Van!!

Spoilers!!Bringing in Bo Katan into this episode was incredible. Katee Sackhoff did an outstanding job as playing Bo Katan (who she voices in The Clone Wars and Rebels). I can't wait to see the next episode and hopefully Ahsoka Tano played by Rosario Dawson! There were tons of important things in this episode that I hope to breakdown with you.Something super important to mention is that Bo says Din Djarin is a child of the watch, children of the watch are a cult of religious zealots who broke away from mandalorian society, their goal is to re-establish the ancient way she¡¦s talking about death watch who were the ones who saved him as a kid.Death watch were hellbent on making Mandalore what it once was, they were very purist and elitist and led by Pre Vizsla  during the Clone Wars who died to Darth Maul in trial by combat. Maul had the dark sober and Bo Katan and the other members of clan Kryze were pushed out.She says that Mandalorians are stronger when together, and he says it¡¦s not part of his plan, as he¡¦s been quested to bringing this child to the Jedi. Bo says she knows of one she can introduce him to, if he helps them with their mission (Ahsoka Tano).We see an awesome few minutes of pure action where the 4 Mandalorians make stormtroopers look like¡Kwell¡Kstormtroopers.Now in regards to the Dark Saber for those who need a quick recap -  The dark saber is basically the Key to uniting Mandalore and the Mandalorian people. Think of the Dark Saber as a key to the planet. Whoever possesses it, rules Mandalore. The only way to take it, is to kill the possessor of the blade, or challenge them to a trial by combat, like Maul did to Pre Viszla. So it makes me wonder how Giddeon did it to Bo, did he take it from her, if so then how is she alive? At the end of Rebels, Sabine gave the saber to Bo to take back Mandalore under her rule, so the gap has yet to be filled in. As they move their way up to the bridge, Moff Gideon talks to the captain via holo, where he learns that it¡¦s the Mandalorians who have attacked the Empire¡¦s other vessels, calling them, pirates.I'm excited to know what Ahsoka Tano is up to. Has she had any kind of communication with Anakin Skywalker in the force now that he's a ghost again?Become a Patron to support future content - https://www.patreon.com/StarWarsTheoryJoin this channel to get access to perks:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q/join#TheMandalorian #StarWars #Ahsoka #BoKatan",290.44996,25,2528,5,765

Spider-Man starring Tobey Maguire was a massive success, and so it made sense to start tackling some other Marvel properties.

Thus was born Ang Lee¡¦s slow-burn, slow-paced Hulk movie in 2003 with the weirdest editing transitions known to man.Ang Lee¡¦s hulk definitely raises some questions. Like why does it take so long to see the Hulk? Why is a movie about a giant green monster that smashes things so slow-paced? What¡¦s up with Hulk fighting dogs? Why is everybody surviving these catastrophic attacks from the Hulk? And seriously, what¡¦s with this editing?To answer all these questions and more, step inside the Pitch Meeting that led to Hulk!

Dave Filoni directed this and he did an amazing job.As we see the barren forest land of Corvus, we spot a major Easter egg, which is the Owl, Morai. Morai is the daughter. For those who haven¡¦t watched the clone wars, then you¡¦ll want to watch my video I made on her (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UD_c8JNUSts) which explains everything about her and Mortis.Ahsoka shows up and fights Mando, which ends quick after Mando tells her he was sent by Bo Katan.As she looks at Baby Yoda, our episode really begins.Ahsoka and Baby Yoda talk over the moonlight, where she reveals his name is Grogu. She says they can feel each other¡¦s thoughts.He was raised at the Jedi temple on coruscant. Many masters trained him over the years. At the end of the clone wars, he was hidden. Someone took him from the temple, then his memory becomes dark.He was lost and alone. So someone has taken his memory. I think there are three people here who could have taken him. One being Mace Windu. Perhaps Mace went directly to the Temple after he fell, and collected Grogu. Or it was Palpatine, who had taken him and that¡¦s why his memory is dark, because maybe he tried to wipe his mind of things, vital things that had to do with the experiments done on Grogu. Or, Jocastu Nu took him, the librarian. Now, she could have taken him, and when she died months after revenge of the Sith, to Vader, which I¡¦ve covered in a video from the marvel comic, I¡¦ll also link below for you, Grogu was on his own and he had to suppress his powers heavily in order to survive. Like Obi-Wan and Yoda did, so that the empire will not find him.The next day Ahsoka trains Grogu, or at least tries. She failed to get Grogu to summon the stone, where Mando tries to get him to summon the knob of the ship¡¦s shifter. It works and Grogu takes the knob with the force. Ahsoka realizes they have a strong bond, and says she can¡¦t train him, for his attachment to Din is too strong. The entire tone of the episode changes when she tells him she¡¦s seen what attachments do to a fully trained Jedi Knight, she is referring to Anakin Skywalker here, who turned to the dark side due to his attachment to Padme and trying to saver her from dying in child birth, which I would argue, was just a dream put into his head by Palpatine. Din makes a deal with her, that she promises to train the child if he helps her defeat the village who hired him to kill her.Ahsoka and Din Djarin take out the town.Facing the magistrate, she toys with her and disarms her, and demands to know where Grand Admiral Thrawn is.Thrawn is out there.Anyhow, the village is freed, and Mando goes to fetch Grogu to give him up to Ahsoka so he can be trained. Meeting him back at his ship, Ahsoka tells Din that she cannot train Grogu. The attachment he has to Din is far too strong. Mando tells him that a deal is a deal, and she alters the deal, but tells him of another way, she tells him to go to Tython, there he will find the ancient ruins of a temple that is strong in the force, place him atop the mountain on the seeing stone, so that Grogu may choose his path. If he reaches out in the force, a Jedi will sense his presence and come looking for him. In my opinion, this Jedi, is Luke Skywalker. I think what will happen is that Luke, who is getting ready to start building his new temple of Jedi students, will feel Grogu and will reach back out to him, to which the connection will be broken by the interference and arrival of Moff Gideon, who has tracked Mando to Tython and unleashes the dark troopers upon him and Grogu. I believe he¡¦ll then kidnap Grogu to kill him for his blood, where Luke Skywalker will come into the scene somehow to help Din get back the child.I think this will all lead to Luke Skywalker who will train Grogu, but not before Moff Gideon takes him from The Mandalorian!Thrawn top 10 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RD77ZsEwhX4The Daughter - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UD_c8JNUStsBecome a Patron to support future content - https://www.patreon.com/StarWarsTheoryJoin this channel to get access to perks:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q/join",328.2402,23,4265,5,786

That¡¦s when Eddie Van Halen spent the day with a guy who had followed in his footsteps playing alongside David Lee Roth¡XJason Becker. Jason had been diagnosed with ALS, or Lou Gehrig¡¦s Disease, and was not in good shape. Van Halen came to Jason¡¦s house to give love and support¡Xas well as a guitar¡Xto his friend and to film an ALS awareness promotional video. During that time, Eddie told stories, talked about his creative process, and played amazing music, instantly sounding exactly like Eddie Van Halen even when playing Jason¡¦s guitar through a small practice amp.This never-before-seen footage shows a side of Eddie Van Halen that goes far beyond his brilliant musicianship: a sweet, caring, generous personality, devoid of the trappings of fame or rock stardom. The video also documents the incredible strength of Jason Becker, who had been deprived of his shot at fame as well as his genius guitar skills, but still found the courage and the will to battle a debilitating disease.¡§Eddie was such a beautiful person,¡¨ says Becker. ¡§He was incredibly kind to me and my family. Not only was he my biggest influence, he had such a huge heart. He honestly saved my life.¡¨This video is a must-see piece of history, not just for guitarists but for everyone. It truly shows the magic of kindness, and a depth of emotion that we can all use more of.https://jasonbecker.com/Triumphant Hearts Available Now: http://smarturl.it/JasonBecker#JasonBecker #EddieVanHalen #EVH #WolfgangVanHalen #VanHalen #ALS #TriumphantHearts #HoldOnToLove",220.24382,4,1723,5,661

Sergino Dest, who is the first American to ever play for Barcelona, gave his side the 1-0 lead with a goal in the 52¡¦ marking his first goal since December 2019 back when he was playing for Ajax. Then just a few minutes later, Barcelona doubled its lead with a Martin Braithwaite goal in the 57¡¦. Barcelona kept their foot on the gas as they laid on another goal in the 70¡¦ when Braithwaite put away his penalty shot to notch his second goal of the evening. Dest almost notched his second goal of the match in the 88¡¦ put sailed it just a bit high. In the 90'+2 Antoine Griezmann added one more goal for insurance to secure the 4-0 win for the Spanish side.

A 2020 recipient of the Country Music Association¡¦s Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award, Pride is an inspiration to generations of performers, a model of quiet dignity and artful fortitude.Raised in the segregated South as the son of a sharecropper, Charley Frank Pride was born on a cotton farm in Sledge, Mississippi, fifty miles south of Memphis. He spent his childhood laboring in fields, playing baseball, and listening to the Grand Ole Opry on a Philco radio. He bought his first guitar when he was fourteen, and began developing a style of singing that would come to impress his heroes.¡§What came from my throat was my voice, no one else¡¦s,¡¨ he wrote in his autobiography. ¡§No one had ever told me that whites were supposed to sing one kind of music and blacks another ¡X I sang what I liked in the only voice I had.¡¨At 16, Pride left Mississippi and played baseball in the Negro American League. He was enamored of Jackie Robinson, who broke Major League Baseball¡¦s color barrier in 1947.¡§To say that he was my idol would be an understatement,¡¨ Pride said. ¡§As far as I was concerned, Jackie Robinson had rewritten the future.¡¨Pride never realized his Major League Baseball dreams, but he rewrote country music¡¦s future. His gifts as a singer were greater than his athletic prowess. In 1962, country stars Red Sovine and Red Foley heard Pride singing in Helena, Montana, and encouraged him to come to Nashville. A year later, Pride auditioned in Nashville for manager Jack Johnson, and Johnson was astounded.Johnson introduced Pride to renegade producer Cowboy Jack Clement. On August 16, 1965, Clement took Pride to RCA¡¦s Nashville studio and recorded demonstration recordings that impressed RCA head man Chet Atkins, who flew to Los Angeles and received approval from the label brass to sign Pride to the label.Pride¡¦s first single, ¡§Snakes Crawl at Night,¡¨ was released in January of 1966. Pride¡¦s race was shielded from country radio disc jockeys until the third single, ¡§Just Between You and Me,¡¨ climbed into the country Top Ten. The cover of his gold-selling first album, Country Charley Pride, was the first time many fans discovered that he was Black.¡§I get a lot of questions asked me . . . ¡¥Charley, how¡¦d you get into country music and why you don¡¦t sound like you¡¦re supposed to sound,¡¦¡¨ Pride said during a 1968 concert at Panther Hall in Fort Worth, Texas. ¡§It¡¦s a little unique, I admit. But I¡¦ve been singing country music since I was about five-years-old. This is why I sound like I sound.¡¨ Pride responded to discrimination with square-jawed silence, determined that talent would overcome prejudice. His work spoke volumes. He was the CMA¡¦s Entertainer of the Year in 1971, and he scored twenty-nine #1 country hits, including enduring classics ¡§Is Anybody Goin¡¦ to San Antone,¡¨ ¡§Kiss an Angel Good Mornin¡¦,¡¨ ¡§All I Have to Offer You Is Me,¡¨ and ¡§Mountain of Love.¡¨ He was named the CMA¡¦s top male vocalist in 1971 and 1972, and was one of RCA¡¦s top-selling artists for decades.Pride was inducted into the Grand Ole Opry in 1993, seven years before his induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame. At the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum¡¦s donation ceremony for Jack Clement¡¦s guitar in 2019 Pride recalled his early recordings. He said that Clement told him, ¡§Charley these songs we¡¦re recording right now, fifty years from now they¡¦re gonna be spinnin¡¦ ¡¥em.¡¨It has been more than fifty years, and those songs are still spinning.",135.7873,11,3797,5,220

This is the Oat & Pecan Brittle Cookies recipe from Dessert Person. This chewy, butterscotchy oat cookie might not be the kind you can casually whip up on a whim. But, if you go through the steps to make it, like making the pecan brittle, grinding the oats, and browning the butter, you will be rewarded with hands-down the most delicious oat cookie you've ever tried. Somewhere between a lacy cookie and a chewy one, it's giant, buttery, and sweet-salty. Make them along with Claire and remember to keep some of the dough frozen so you're never more than 20 minutes away from a perfect warm cookie.

The initial idea was to have the player itself be a smaller copy of the level that can navigate inside itself. So you could do things to the level to give yourself certain abilities or do things to yourself to modify the level. There weren't many amazing directions to take this, so I thought of something else:What if the level contained a smaller copy of itself, and the player character can navigate between the different recursive instances. The idea is cool I guess, but programming it turned out to be quite the challenge - ultimately involving the use of a render texture and quickly swapping out the controlled player copy.The final 2D golf based game is full of some mind-bending mechanics involving scaling the player, changing gravity, and duplicating yourself. --- MUSIC ---¡÷ Sidearm by INTL.CMD - https://soundcloud.com/intlcmd¡÷ Pookatori and Friends by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)¡÷ Crazy by Antti Luode",295.99492,20,1233,6,638

The Mandalorian Season 2 Episode 6 finally shows the one and only, Boba Fett in the spotlight. We see Boba return and eventually help Din Djarin and Grogu against Moff Gideon's Storm Troopers and Dark Troopers (phase 2 I think), who end up taking Grogu.Fennec Shand reminds me a lot of Zam Wessel from Attack of the Clones, who was pursued by Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, until Jango showed up.We also learn a lot about Jango Fett, Boba Fett's Father. We learn that Jango Fett was a Mandalorian! This is awesome! Since it was skewed in canon, it's nice to know we finally have an answer. They seem to be following his story from Open Seasons comic book series which shows the story of Jango as a boy. Long story short, Jango was the son of a farmer on Concord Dawn. A man named Jaster Mereel who was leader of the True Mandalorians, was on the run from a traitor named Tor Vizsla from Death Watch. Jango¡¦s dad hid Jaster Mereel in his farm, and told Jango that he was feeding some homeless men. When Tor Vizsla came looking near Jango¡¦s Dad¡¦s farm, he found Jango¡¦s Dad and beat him up infant of Jango, until Jango¡¦s mom created a distraction and Jango ran for his life, leaving his parents who were immediately murdered, Fett ran into Jaster Mereel who eventually took the boy under his wing and recruited him in the Mandalorian Civil War against Death Watch, as one of the True Mandalorians. Jaster died eventually and Jango avenged him, becoming the leader of the True Mandalorians. Now the people who found Din, were death watch, so the two clans have always been waging wars against one another and have varying beliefs. Explaining this to Din, Din accepts that the armour belongs to Boba. So this armour, is just repainted from his dad¡¦s, from Jango¡¦s. The deal is done, says Din, where Boba assures him that it is not, as he promised the safety of the child in return for his armour. Now Boba joins the crew until the child is safe. Flying in the Slave 1, they arrive on Nevarro 7, where Cara Dune is now a New Republic Marshal, where he asks her to locate Mayfeld, who you might remember from season 1. Mando is going to spring him out of jail to locate Moff Gideon¡¦s cruiser.We jump to Moff Gideon¡¦s light cruiser, he walks to the cell containing the child.As Moff Gideon enters, we see Grogu using the force on stormtroopers. Even going as far as using force choke, to which many might think is a dark side move, but, I should mention, Luke Skywalker used it as well in Return of the Jedi, and he was far from the dark side.As Grogu knocks them out, Gideon steps up to him and ignites his dark saber, asking Grogu if he remembers one of these, meaning if he remembers using a lightsaber or having seen many lightsabers during his time as a Jedi at the Jedi Temple before Order 66. Grogu is tired, I think because he had to cut himself off from the force for so long that he isn¡¦t used to using it as much as when he was at the Jedi temple learning from the many masters. Using the force can also tire one out, like it does to Luke in the empire strikes back when failing to lift the x-wing out of Yoda¡¦s swamp. They blast Grogu with a stun blast, and cuff him. Gideon tells his officer to contact Dr. Pershing, the cloning doctor responsible for the experiments on the child, to tell him that they have their donor. The plan now is for Gideon to kill Grogu to harvest all of his blood which has force powers, or in Star Wars lingo, a high Midichlorian count. End of the episode.It was amazing. Simply amazing. My favourite episode of the entire show so far, which is saying a lot. Boba is back and badder than ever, as Terry Silver would say. I think the next episode will revolve around rescuing Mayfeld from Jail, and then tracking the light cruiser or going to Dr. Pershing who will have the child momentarily. I think the season finale will end in a Big Bang all out battle like end game. With everyone we¡¦ve seen from this season fighting together against Moff Gideon and his dark troopers, as he himself gets in a phase 3 dark trooper mega suit to destroy Din. Hopefully Ahsoka Tano returns with Bo Katan, and we get to see another Jedi, Luke or Ezra is my guess.Become a Patron to support future content - https://www.patreon.com/StarWarsTheoryJoin this channel to get access to perks:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q/join",507.56562,27,4396,5,851

This ship is sailing dead ahead to its final port of call, where it has been sold for scrap alongside dozens of other ships that have become the latest victims of the global pandemic. The Chittagong ship breaking yard in Bangladesh is the largest of its kind in the world, and in the past few months even its abundant shores have become inundated with pleasure cruises and industrial cargo ships alike that all could have otherwise sailed the oceans for many more decades. These are all very troubling signs for the unsung heroes of our modern global economy, the merchant marine fleet. Every year trillions of dollars worth of cargo is transported on ships like these and losing this fleet could turn into a huge barrier to global trade.But what is really going on here?Why would profit-motivated companies destroy billions of dollars worth of productive assets? Sure times are tough, tourism and trade have declined massively but this hardly looks like a reasonable response right?I don¡¦t burn down my house if a video gets less than 10,000 likes, so why would companies in such a competitive industry do something equally as self-destructive?Well as always it has to do with economics (go figure) and to understand this bizarre behavior we need to understand a few key areas.What are the economics behind the merchant marine fleet?How do these factors make it financially viable to destroy ships?what does this mean for the future of international trade?And what does this all have to do with Chinese bridge building?Enjoyed the video?

The game lived up to its high-octane hype at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta.Alabama wide receiver DeVonta Smith recovered Florida's onside kick attempt with 2:09 left to end a furious charge that made a game out of what once looked like a blowout. The Gators went 75 yards on 10 plays and hit paydirt to get within striking distance on a remarkable 22-yard touchdown toss from Kyle Trask to Kyle PItts. Florida coach Dan Mullen then decided to go for two with Trask running in for the conversion. Trask finished with 408 yards, four total touchdowns and a fumble.That after Crimson Tide QB Mac Jones hit Smith for a 15-yard touchdown with 4:59 in the game to push Alabama's lead to 52-38 and put pressure on the Gators. Jones finished with 418 yards, five touchdowns and an interception.Alabama got things rolling quickly by going 70 yards on nine plays on its first drive of the game. Touchdown drives of 31 yards, 73 yards, 70 yards and 78 yards followed during a first half in which punter Charlie Scott never saw the field. #SEC #Alabama #Florida #NajeeHarris #NickSaban #KyleTrask #KylePitts #MacJones #DevontaSmith #Gators #CrimsonTide",160.72442,4,1369,5,1703

So here¡¦s one that at first glance will make you roll your eyes, but by the end of this video, I think you¡¦ll be able to see a lot of the plausibility of things.The more I write this theory, the more it makes sense, but first we need to understand a lot of lore and backstory, so sit tight, and enjoy this one with me.In Star Wars Revenge of the Sith, Mace Windu fell out of the window, and we haven¡¦t seen the Jedi Master since. We saw a figment of his return in one of the Vader comics by Marvel which I have full coverage on with voice acting, if you can call it that, now this Mace isn¡¦t really Mace, it¡¦s some weird fragmented animated version of him....can we say he¡¦s truly dead?In this theory video, I¡¦m going to say he didn¡¦t die that day. The theory I have behind this, is that we heard his voice speak to Rey in the rise of Skywalker. You¡¦re probably thinking, well¡Kthat definitely means he¡¦s dead, right?Sure, maybe, but, how did he speak to Rey? If it wasn¡¦t for Qui-Gon Jinn, no one would be a force ghost. Qui-Gon Jinn met with the shaman of the whills, now these were ancient powerful beings, almost like priests of some sorts. During Qui-Gon¡¦s life, they taught him how to transfer his essence beyond death. However, due to his untimely demise, he wasn¡¦t able to complete his training, therefore only able to manifest his voice as a ghost, and not his body, until much later near a new hope which can be read in the book from a certain point of view. In Revenge of the Sith, Qui-Gon¡¦s force ghost speaks to Yoda, it was cut from the film, but it was dialogued in the deleted scenes and written in the original script. That moment on Polis Massa where Yoda is meditating during Padme¡¦s labor, to which Bail Organa, the future adopted father of Leia, interrupts Yoda¡¦s communication with Qui-Gon. Once Padme dies and obi-wan and Yoda speak, we learn that Qui-Gon is now Yoda¡¦s master, who has taught him how to commune with him in the force. To Obi-Wan¡¦s surprise, Qui-Gon is still very much around in the force.So, where did he go? The Star Wars galaxy is huge, and it¡¦s possible that he fled somewhere, or went in hiding, just like Yoda, Obi-Wan and the rest of the survivors of Order 66. What if he went somewhere to some unknown planet in the unknown regions somewhere to hide and train more Jedi? What if he became a Mandalorian? Nothing would suit his scarred and recognizable face better than hiding under a helmet. This leads me to my next theory, what if Mace Windu is in The Mandalorian? What if he shows up in season2 or 3 or more? Mace Windu was unbelievably powerful, so powerful that he went toe to toe with the Emperor.Now, if Mace is alive, seeing him as a Mandalorian would not just be cool, it would fit a lot of the story for the Jedi that could help reunite the child with his species. There is no person in the galaxy that knows Yoda better than Mace Windu. He sat with him as second in command, and in some cases, first in command. Mace in a lot of ways, was the chosen one. He used the light and the dark, he was the master of his emotions, and he had surpassed all of his teachers as a young boy, growing to become the most powerful Jedi just before Anakin could see his full potential until he lost to OBiWan.Let¡¦s say Mando takes The Child to Ahsoka, and she eventually tells him of someone who can really show him the way to reuniting the Child with its species, pointing him to another Easter egg hunt throughout the galaxy, to Mace Windu.Mace could be laying low, perhaps growing his crops and training those who exhibited force powers at an early age. Perfecting his abilities and learning more about all aspects of the force, and eventually along the way, learning a ton from Yoda who communed with him, and Obi-Wan after their deaths. Perhaps even, coming across Luke Skywalker and learning of the fate of Anakin and the Emperor. Teaching Luke so much about his father¡¦s youth.This could be Mace¡¦s return, this could be how Mace fits into the Mandalorian. So you¡¦re probably saying, well ok, but what about his death¡Kwell¡KWhat if while the Mando is finding the path to Mace Windu, he is followed by someone notorious flying the Slave 1 ship and once he does leave Mace, with the information on where to reunite The Child with his parents, Boba comes to him. How poetic would it be if Mace Windu¡¦s death came full circle, and what I mean is, Boba Fett finds him, and kills him, transcending him into the force¡Kavenging his father, Jango.Become a Patron to support future content - https://www.patreon.com/StarWarsTheoryJoin this channel to get access to perks:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q/joinedited @Star Wars Elseworlds thumbnail @Benny Productions music @Samuel Kim Music",621.33344,27,4809,7,529

Unlike conventional airplanes, tail sitting planes rested on their tails and used engine power alone to lift off the ground before transitioning to vertical flight, and returning to land vertically once again on their tail. The configuration, although technically challenging to develop, would allow aircraft to operate without runways, fundamentally changing how and where air forces could use their aircraft. In the early 1950s French aerospace firm SNECMA (Societe nationale d'etudes et de construction de moteurs d'aviation) began developing wingless test rigs to prove the viability of the tail sitting concept. At the time, American firms were also developing tail sitting prototypes of their own, But SNECMA would take it a step further by developing a tail sitting aircraft with a highly unconventional annular (cylindrical) wing. The cylindrical wing promised greater efficiency over a conventional wing by eliminating wing-tip vortices. It would also be more compact, further reducing the space needed for vertical take-off and landings. French designers also theorised that a cylindrical wing could eventually be engineered to function as a ramjet engine, propelling the aircraft to supersonic speeds.The C.450 Coleoptere was constructed in 1958, with tethered flight testing beginning in early 1959. By May, the unconventional plane had achieved its first successful unassisted hover, even reaching altitudes of 800 meters. Despite early successes during flight tests, flaws soon emerged in the aircraft¡¦s design. The Coleoptere proved extremely difficult to pilot. An innovative pilot seat could swivel 90 degrees, but pilots still struggled to judge the aircraft¡¦s distance from the ground while landing. Without a conventional wing to provide resistance, the Coleoptere also had a tendency to slowly spin on its axis. On July 25, 1959, the Coleoptere performed it¡¦s 9th test flight. This time, the pilot was to transition the aircraft from vertical to horizontal flight, a challenging procedure that would mark a huge milestone for the program. The Coleoptere lifted off successfully, but during its transition, it suddenly became too inclined and slow-moving to maintain altitude. The aircraft started tumbling back to earth as the pilot struggled to regain control, barely managing to eject at the very last minute. The Coleoptere was destroyed.A second prototype of the Coleoptere would never be built. By the 1960¡¦s it was clear that the tail sitting configuration was a dead-end. It was simply too much of a compromise when it came to payload and range, and far too difficult to pilot. It was clear that vectoring thrust, allowing the aircraft to remain horizontal, was a more practical and safer solution.

The final confrontation between the spritely HLN-A and the villainous Sir Edmund Rockwell occurs on a gigantic colony ship traveling through deep space. Players will need to draw on all their ARK experience to succeed. ARK's largest Expansion Pack yet has game-changing additions for every kind of Survivor: whether it's taking possession of enemies via brain-controlling Noglin creatures, zooming around doing radical tricks on the skateboard-like Hoversail, or managing and viewing your base remotely with security cameras, among tons of other new items and creatures!   This expansion pack also introduces new voiceover talent to the ARK universe with David Tennant (Doctor Who, Good Omens) playing the villainous Sir Edmund Rockwell, and Madeleine Madden (The Wheel of Time, Picnic at Hanging Rock, Dora and the Lost City of Gold) taking on the in-game robotic AI companion HLN-A/Helena Walker.But even with HLN-A's help, will your powerful skills, gear, and tames be sufficient to put a stop to Rockwell's demented plans once and for all?

I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Fixing and giving makeovers to squishies is such a fun painting project, and a great creative art activity. It's been keeping me busy for years <U+0001F602> Hopefully you like my creations this episode. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! 3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily. ___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh <U+0001F602> ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess.

Emmy winner Bob Odenkirk (Better Call Saul, The Post, Nebraska) stars as Hutch Mansell, an underestimated and overlooked dad and husband, taking life¡¦s indignities on the chin and never pushing back. A nobody.  When two thieves break into his suburban home one night, Hutch declines to defend himself or his family, hoping to prevent serious violence. His teenage son, Blake (Gage Munroe, The Shack), is disappointed in him and his wife, Becca (Connie Nielsen, Wonder Woman), seems to pull only further away. The aftermath of the incident strikes a match to Hutch¡¦s long-simmering rage, triggering dormant instincts and propelling him on a brutal path that will surface dark secrets and lethal skills. In a barrage of fists, gunfire and squealing tires, Hutch must save his family from a dangerous adversary (famed Russian actor Aleksey Serebryakov, Amazon¡¦s McMafia)¡Xand ensure that he will never be underestimated as a nobody again.Nobody is directed by acclaimed filmmaker Ilya Naishuller (Hardcore Henry), from a script by Derek Kolstad, the narrative architect of the John Wick franchise, and co-stars legendary Emmy winner Christopher Lloyd as Hutch¡¦s father and multi-hyphenate musician-actor RZA as Hutch¡¦s brother, whose own hidden talents aid Hutch in his quest for vengeance.  The film is produced by Kelly McCormick, p.g.a, and David Leitch, p.g.a., the filmmakers of Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw, Deadpool 2 and Atomic Blonde, for their company 87North, by Braden Aftergood, p.g.a.

His work spans decades and it took multiple tries to understand it in a way that could be put together in a narrative. I am very grateful for all of his time, warmth and generosity. I had to leave many, many wonderful pieces of research and factoids out due to time constraints but I would urge any of you that are interested to dive deeper into his work. His colleagues Dr. William G. Ryerson, Ms. Amanda E. Hewes andMs. Sara Horwitz contributed a great deal to some of the research that I mentioned.Dr. Margaret Rubega (https://rubegalab.uconn.edu/) deserves thanks for introducing me to Kurt in the first place.Additional footage licensed from:Pond5.comEnvato ElementsVideoblocks.comShutterstock.com",259.5495,11,997,5,639

I live in East Village in a 250 square foot studio. My rent was originally $2000 per month, but was recently reduced to $1800 per month, which is about the current market rate for a studio apartment in NYC. I told myself I¡¦d chill out on the decor this time, so I was originally planning on keeping the place pretty minimalist and not recording an apartment makeover. But as they say.. you can lead an Ashley to an apartment, but you can¡¦t make her resist her impulse to wallpaper every single surface. So anyways, here¡¦s my apartment tour, complete with a small jungle worth of house plants, an abundance of vintage gold mirrors, my trusty pink armchair, and some questionable NYC storage solutions. I¡¦m not quite sure how to describe my decor aesthetic - it¡¦s somewhere between grandma chic, tumblr chic, and i-own-way-too-much-stuff-so-i-hid-everything-in-ikea-boxes chic.

Its ridiculous, its dumb, but its also kind of awesome if you're into that sort of thing.

My friend has found it on the steel waste together with the german <U+201E>Weltrekord¡§ ratchet screwdriver. The condition of the drill was super bad. It was very corroded, had a lot of missing screws, the handle was in very bad condition and the crank was bent so much you couldn't even make a full turn. That's all said, it was the perfect item for a new restoration video.At first I thought this should be a quick and easy project, but one problem after the other became visible and it turned out to be a real challenge. There was the big dent in the left side of the case. Usually you can't bend casted parts, but with a bit of heat and careful pressure on the arbor press I was able to remove it a bit. It also worked to get rid of the warping with some heat. For the finish of the housing I wanted to have an antique cast aluminium look. I thought it would look very cool if I could tumbler these parts after sandblasting. I ended up building a huge rotary tumbler from scratch and it worked very well (video link below).Another big issue was the tool holder and the drill bit, as they were both completly rusted. Big thanks to @Hand Tool Rescue  at this point for helping me out with the dimensions on these two parts by disassembling and measuring his own hammer drill. After a bit of search on eBay I found a set of original Rawlplug drill bits. After they arrived I was able to measure the shaft and the taper of the drill to then turn a new tool holder. It all worked out very well and yes, the drill only holds with the taper ;-)Before I even started this project I just had one question in mind <U+201E>How am I going to replace the messed up handle cover?¡§. My first idea was to wrap it in nice black leather like steering wheels are made. That would definitely work, but that's something I've never done before so I was quite sceptical. Then the idea of a heat shrink tube came up. That would be a very easy solution, but heat shrink tubes don't have any structuires to it and it wouldn't quite fit the the rest of the tool. Thanks to the research of my Patreons and channel members, they have found very special heat shrink tubes that have a structure in it. I really liked it as it almost looked exactly the same like the original handle.After all it was a very intense and time consuming project. I've done so many hours of research on this one and I had to learn new skills. I'm very happy how it turned out.I hope you like my work and the video.Huge thank you to all of my Patreon supporters and specially to:Tonya M BroermanZack ThompsonAdel AlSaffarafreeflyingsoulYale BakerGregoryAlex McGeorgeAlistair MoorAmar.kBendurionCourtney MaleportDavid BarkerGreg MarstonJoshua BentleyLambda GPU WorkstationsLuke SchmickLuke StoneMatt BoschMellissa MarcusMike SchlodderMonte GibbsMuzaffer AksoyNick HoustonPaul MampillypotokslowTodd MedburyVickie BlighVince ValentiXavier CarbelYuri ZapuchlakAaron QuanteAlex Bretonalex latzkoAllen FrankAmanda Taylor, EsqAndreas MimraAndrew PhillipsAnthony AdamsArni Bjorgvinssonaudi4444playerBlake TBrandon FitzwaterBrian NewtonCarloChad BryantChris SimondetGrok SenftenHaley McFaddenHarper KimHunter R.Jason KoiJason TarlovJeremy ColeJonas RichartzJordan Pagejustin f.Kelly ImgrundKurt GazowMarc CerisierMarius CostanMartin Ronnow KlarlundMellissa McConnellMichael BierMickey EisenhornMike DonaldsonNick CannonPasacal SchmikalPhilippSchultes ThomasScott MarshallSergei ShvartsmanSvenja KucklaThe CarlsonsTrevor KamTucker IfftWarren G Strand JrWilliam Wallace<U+C6C5><U+B85D> <U+C724>My camera:Panasonic HC-VX11If you have any questions about the process, machines i'm using or other stuff, just ask me in the comments.
